# AI Research Team Ops

This folder defines roles and protocols for "AI operating like a research team."

## Roles

- `lead.md`: research lead (scope, priority, decisions)
- `scout.md`: literature scout (search, triage, summaries)
- `experimenter.md`: experimenter (prototypes, evaluation, reproducibility)
- `writer.md`: writer (narrative, figures, manuscript)
- `reviewer.md`: reviewer (counterclaims, weaknesses, related-work gaps)

## Operating rules (short)

- All topics live under `topics/<id>-<slug>/`
- Every claim must link to evidence (papers, experiments, data)
- Record decisions in `topics/.../decisions.md`
