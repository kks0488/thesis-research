# Title
Mergeable PR Agents for Enterprise Repositories

# Keywords
software engineering, coding agents, verification loop, CI, mergeable PR rate, program repair, repository context

# TL;DR
We want ideas that improve the **mergeable PR rate** of autonomous coding agents in enterprise repos by strengthening verification, routing, and context management under strict CI policies.

# Abstract
This workshop description defines a focused research space: autonomous coding agents that generate PRs for enterprise repositories, where the primary success metric is **mergeable PR rate** (PRs that pass required checks and are realistically mergeable). The goal is to propose new algorithmic or system ideas that are feasible with standard CI pipelines and repository metadata. The research should emphasize verification loops (tests, lint, type checks), failure taxonomy and recovery, and context selection under limited budget. Proposed experiments should be simple, reproducible, and compare against minimal baselines such as single-shot generation or one-pass test execution. We prefer ideas that provide clear, measurable improvements in mergeable PR rate or reduce time/cost while maintaining quality. Avoid ideas that require proprietary datasets, large-scale infrastructure, or manual intervention beyond standard CI and code review policies.
